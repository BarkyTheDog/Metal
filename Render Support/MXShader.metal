/*	vertex_main
 *

 *
 *		There are two ways to access the individual vertices in our geometry.
 *	This uses one, where we declare a 'stage_in' parameter for the vertices
 *	in our geometry and set the attributes to signfiy which buffer holds
 *	our geometry.
 *
 *		The second is to declarae a [[vertex_id]] index as an index into an
 *	array containing all of the vertices.
 *
 *		Note that by default the range of our geometry is [-1,1] in X and Y.

 *
 *		The main fragment shader function used by our GPU. In general this would

 *
 *		Note that as we move from our vertex shader to our fragment shader,
 *	values that are not marked with the position attribute are simply
 *	interpolated. For complex operations such as texture mapping, this allows
 *	us to map textures with a little more effort.
 *
 *		Here, of course, we're boring and we just output the interpolated color.
