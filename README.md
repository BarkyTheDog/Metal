# Example 5

The Example 5 branch of the Metal project shows the additional steps for adding ambient, diffuse and specular lighting effects to the system, by extending the fragment shader of our renderer.

When compiled and run you should see a rotating teapot with lighting effects:

# The Full Paper

This example is the first of several examples documented in my PDF available at the [Chaos In Motion Blog](https://chaosinmotion.blog/papers/); look for "Learning the Metal API" for the latest.

# Metal

I'm in the process of trying to learn the [Metal API](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) for the Macintosh. These are the example applications I'm constructing in order to illustrate parts of Metal in a step-by-step organized way.

Metal, for those who don't know, is a low-level API for performing GPU operations, such as real-time graphics or compute-bound tasks. Because Metal is a low-level API, it is very powerful and very fast--and very *very* complicated.

And while there are a few "introduction to Metal" documents and web sites out there, quite a few of them seem to fall short when going beyond the very basic steps of presenting a triangle or perhaps a teapot. Which is cool if you want to just do basic stuff. But can be a pain if you want to do something more complicated.

Thus these examples, and hopefully a PDF-based book which links to these examples (and to web sites discussing the different parts of Metal).

Because as they say, the best way to learn something is to try to teach it to someone else.
